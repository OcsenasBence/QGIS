# QGIS Project

This project was developed during my university studies in the "Geoinformatics" course. The objective was to process and analyze geospatial data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database, culminating in the creation of an interactive web map.

## Project Overview

The project involves selecting a specific area from the OSM database and processing it to meet various requirements. The final output is an interactive web map that has been published for public access.

## Repository Contents

- **Raster Data Files**:
  - `Raszter csővezeték.tif`: Raster image representing pipeline data.
  - `Raszter kalkuláció.tif`: Raster image related to calculations performed during the project.
  - `Raszter utak.tif`: Raster image depicting road networks.

- **Auxiliary XML Files**:
  - `Raszter csővezeték.tif.aux.xml`: Auxiliary metadata for the pipeline raster image.
  - `Raszter kalkuláció.tif.aux.xml`: Auxiliary metadata for the calculation raster image.
  - `Raszter utak.tif.aux.xml`: Auxiliary metadata for the road networks raster image.

- **Compressed Raster Files**:
  - `Compressed Raszter csővezeték.tif`: Compressed version of the pipeline raster image.
  - `Compressed Raszter kalkuláció.tif`: Compressed version of the calculation raster image.
  - `Compressed Raszter utak.tif`: Compressed version of the road networks raster image.

- **README.md**: Project description and overview.

## Interactive Web Map

## Getting Started

To explore and utilize the data in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OcsenasBence/QGIS.git
   cd QGIS
   ```

2. **Open the Raster Files**:
   Use GIS software such as QGIS to open and analyze the `.tif` files provided in the repository.

3. **Access the Interactive Map**:
   Visit the [Interactive Web Map](https://qgiscloud.com/OcsenasBence/Projekt) to view the processed geospatial data in an interactive format.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the "Geoinformatics" course and aims to provide practical experience in processing and visualizing geospatial data using QGIS and OpenStreetMap resources.
